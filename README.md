<h1>LinkedIn Post: Communication is Key</h1>

<h2>Summary</h2>
I thought of this post while at the hospital with my wife. An interaction I had with the nurse allowed me to identify I was on the "user" side of the
conversation and noticed that the same communication challenges that we deal with in technology exist in the exact same way here in the hospital, and
by extension, pretty much the same way in every industry. It's obvious when you think about it, but I don't think it's something we often consider.
Skills can be specific, but good communication is universal.

Communication is Key

Hi all,

This week’s been a little different. We’ve spent the last few days in the hospital for my wife’s unexpected procedure. She’s doing okay — definitely hurting, but improving each day. Hopefully surgery gets the green light tomorrow.

I bring this up because a few interactions got me thinking about how tailored communication affects how we do business.

In everyday life, we often use vague or polite language around personal topics. I asked a nurse for help — twice — using careful, roundabout phrasing. She responded bluntly with exactly what I was trying not to say… and of course, she was right. She was able to help because she deals with this stuff daily and is used to decoding vague explanations like mine.
That’s when it clicked. She’s a technical expert. To help, she needs clear, specific info to assess the issue and act on it — just like a network analyst or sysadmin does in tech. The more detailed the report, the better the fix.

But that’s the opposite of how we talk to non-technicals. Take family updates, for example — just like stakeholder reports at work. In those cases, we avoid technical detail. We use analogies or high-level summaries to convey the gist of what happened so they can understand the impact, even if they don’t understand the system.

The key is knowing which approach to use.

You’ve probably heard that in IT, we troubleshoot people as much as tech. This is exactly what that means. Stakeholders describe problems based on their understanding, which is often incomplete or flawed. That’s okay. It’s not their job to know the tech. It’s our job to translate their experience into actionable intel. That ability to bridge the gap is critical in cybersecurity and IT roles. That’s why user manuals differ from technical guides, and why we write different reports for execs versus engineers.

It makes sense that this challenge exists in other fields too. It was just eye-opening to see it from the other side for once.

Anyone can learn specs and tools of any industry. But the real key to being a great professional? Being a great communicator.

Stay safe and have fun. I’m off to the hospital cafeteria, which, surprisingly, is pretty good.
